This is the second challenge made by me for Frontend Projects on Roadmap website
# How to use the web application 
We have a navbar to explore the whole page, that's why, if you need to move to any section of the page, you have to press the name of the section on the navbar. Navbar is located at the top of the page.
If you need back at the previous page, you only press the name of the section and thatÂ´s all
